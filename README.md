# Multithreading Image Processor - MIP

##### Project that aims to develop an image processing system using the [dart:io](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.19.6/dart-io/dart-io-library.html), [dart:isolate](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.19.6/dart-isolate/dart-isolate-library.html) library and the dart [image](https://pub.dev/packages/image) package.

## The objective

##### The objective of this project is to study the different possible uses of isolates, which are a great tool in the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) programming language, but which are still recent and little studied.

## Does it work in Flutter?

##### Yes, it works in Flutter, but isolates are not available in Flutter Web, only on: Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and Mac.
